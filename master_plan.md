# Master Plan: Conversational Calendar Assistant

## Vision

Build a truly conversational calendar assistant that feels like talking to a real human assistant who takes as much load off your hands as you want, and adapts to your way of working. The experience should be seamless, contextual, and human-like.

## Development Strategy: Python-First Rapid Prototyping

**Build everything in Python first** to rapidly iterate on functionality before moving to Swift. This allows us to:

- Test complex features quickly
- Validate user experience patterns
- Iterate on conversational flows
- Perfect the LLM interactions
- Build a solid foundation before native implementation

## Completed Work âœ…

- âœ… End-to-end CLI tests with full pipeline testing (CLI â†’ LLM â†’ EventKit)
- âœ… LLM-first edge case handling with timeout and clarification support
- âœ… Pure LLM-driven parsing (no rule-based fallbacks)
- âœ… Comprehensive edge case test suite
- âœ… Enhanced system prompts for misspellings, poor grammar, and ambiguous requests

## Prototype (v0.x): Conversational Calendar Assistant

### Core Functionality

- âœ… Natural language calendar management
- âœ… LLM-driven command interpretation
- âœ… EventKit integration
- âœ… Edge case handling with clarification

### Conversational Context & UX Improvements

#### Context Awareness

- **Conversation Memory**: Remember previous commands and context within session
- **User Preferences**: Learn and adapt to user's scheduling patterns and preferences
- **Contextual Suggestions**: "You usually have team standup on Mondays at 10am, should I schedule that?"
- **Follow-up Handling**: "Move it to 2pm" (knows what "it" refers to from previous command)

#### Human-Like Interaction

- **Proactive Suggestions**: "I notice you have a gap at 3pm, would you like me to schedule that project review we discussed?"
- **Adaptive Responses**: Match user's communication style (formal vs casual)
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Recognize stress levels and adjust assistance accordingly
- **Natural Language**: "I'm swamped today" â†’ "Let me help you prioritize and reschedule some meetings"

#### Workflow Adaptation

- **Learning Patterns**: "You always schedule 1:1s on Fridays, should I suggest that?"
- **Work Style Matching**: Adapt to whether user prefers detailed planning or quick scheduling
- **Context Switching**: Handle interruptions and return to previous tasks seamlessly
- **Multi-step Conversations**: "Schedule the meeting, then remind me to prepare the agenda"

#### Intelligent Assistance

- **Conflict Resolution**: "You have a conflict with the 3pm meeting. Should I reschedule it or the new one?"
- **Smart Defaults**: "You usually have 30-minute meetings, is that good for this one?"
- **Proactive Management**: "I see you have 5 meetings back-to-back. Would you like me to add some buffer time?"
- **Contextual Help**: "I can help you with that. Would you like me to show you your availability first?"

### Edge Case Handling & Robustness

#### Input Normalization (LLM handles)

- âœ… Misspellings: "shedule" â†’ "schedule"
- âœ… Poor grammar: Extract core intent
- âœ… Mixed case/whitespace: Normalize automatically
- âœ… Punctuation: Handle gracefully

#### Date/Time Robustness (LLM clarifies)

- âœ… Invalid dates: Detect and explain issues
- âœ… Ambiguous dates: "next Monday" when today is Monday
- âœ… Relative dates: "in 3 days", "this weekend"
- âœ… Time ambiguity: "noon" vs "12pm", "lunch time"

#### Event Management (LLM asks)

- âœ… Event not found: Provide helpful alternatives
- âœ… Multiple matches: List options for clarification
- âœ… Duplicate events: Detect and ask for confirmation
- âœ… Recurring events: Handle series vs single occurrence

#### Natural Language (LLM adapts)

- âœ… Vague requests: Ask for clarification
- âœ… Context dependencies: Maintain conversation context
- âœ… Complex requests: Break down multi-step operations
- âœ… Conditional logic: "if I'm free tomorrow, schedule meeting"

#### System Resilience

- âœ… API timeouts: Graceful handling with retry logic
- âœ… Rate limiting: Intelligent backoff strategies
- âœ… Network issues: Offline mode with sync when available
- âœ… Performance: Handle large calendars efficiently

### New Features to Add

#### Event Management

- **Event Copying**: "copy team meeting to next week"
- **Bulk Operations**: "delete all meetings this week" (with confirmation)
- **Event Templates**: "schedule a 1:1 meeting" (predefined templates)
- **Attendee Management**: "invite john@email.com to the meeting"

#### Advanced Scheduling

- **Availability Checking**: "if I'm free tomorrow at 2pm, schedule the meeting"
- **Conflict Resolution**: "find a time that works for both of us"
- **Recurring Patterns**: "schedule daily standup every weekday at 9am"
- **Travel Time**: "schedule meeting at the office, accounting for 30min travel time"

#### Search & Discovery

- **Fuzzy Search**: "find meetings about project X"
- **Attendee Filtering**: "show meetings with John"
- **Date Range Queries**: "what meetings do I have next week?"
- **Content Search**: "find meetings where we discussed the budget"

#### Smart Features

- **Undo Operations**: "undo my last action"
- **Action History**: "what did I just schedule?"
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: "are you sure you want to delete all meetings?"
- **Smart Suggestions**: "you usually have lunch at noon, should I block that time?"

### Email Integration (Moved from MVP)

#### Multi-platform Email Support

- **Gmail Integration**: Read, send, categorize emails
- **Apple Mail**: Native macOS integration
- **IMAP/SMTP**: Generic email protocol support

- **Email Summaries**: "summarize my emails and suggest calendar actions"
- **Follow-up Tracking**: "remind me to follow up on this email next week"

### Checklist/Note Storage

#### Persistent Context

- **Checklist Storage**: "I have 5 things to do and want the assistant to remember them"
- **Context-Aware Conversations**: "add 'review budget' to my checklist"
- **Smart Suggestions**: "you mentioned wanting to review the budget, should I schedule time for that?"
- **Integration**: Connect checklists with calendar events

#### Note Management

- **Context Preservation**: "what did we discuss in last week's meeting?"

### Core Integration â€” Phase One

Core is the inference layer that turns a reactive assistant into a proactive, intelligent agent. It gives the MVP semantic memory, narrative awareness, and long-term recall by embedding and indexing life data â€” starting with calendar events, later expanding to reminders, email, and conversations.

#### âœ… Current Status

- **Working Apple Calendar integration** with full conversational control
- **EventKit + GPT-4o pipeline** live
- **Prototype driven by tests**
- **Cursor auto-mode** in place
- **Embedding tech** not yet implemented but central to the vision

#### ðŸ”œ Phase One Goals

1. **Create First Embedding Index**

   - Extract titles + descriptions from past calendar events
   - Embed using OpenAI or similar
   - Store locally in JSON or a vector DB like ChromaDB

2. **Implement recall() Function**

   - Enable semantic search for similar past events
   - Use in commands like: "Schedule my usual Tuesday check-in with B"

3. **Contextual Nudging**

   - Add logic to suggest likely next actions
   - Example: "You usually check email around this time â€” want me to open it?"

4. **Structured Memory Types**
   - Define types of memory Core will hold:
     - **Past Events** (calendar, reminders, emails)
     - **Intentions** (e.g. "I want to get fitter")
     - **Commitments** (e.g. "follow up with Anna")
     - **Preferences** (e.g. "no meetings before 11am")
   - Draft a JSON schema or begin logging from tests and user inputs

### Advanced Conversational Features

#### Multi-modal Interaction

- **Voice Input**: "hey assistant, schedule a meeting"
- **Voice Output**: "I've scheduled your meeting for tomorrow at 2pm"
- **Image Recognition**: "schedule a meeting based on this screenshot of my calendar"
- **Document Parsing**: "create calendar events from this PDF agenda"

#### Intelligent Automation

- **Workflow Automation**: "when I get a meeting invite, automatically check my availability"
- **Smart Routing**: "forward calendar conflicts to my assistant"
- **Proactive Alerts**: "warn me if I have too many meetings in a day"
- **Auto-optimization**: "suggest a better schedule for my week"

#### Personalization

- **Learning Preferences**: Adapt to user's communication style and work patterns
- **Custom Commands**: "when I say 'busy day', show me my schedule and suggest breaks"
- **Contextual Shortcuts**: "my usual" for frequently used scheduling patterns
- **Work Style Adaptation**: Match user's planning vs spontaneous scheduling style
